Summary: "I made it!"
---

If working on my thesis was what graduate school is like, I think I'm going to love it. During my final semester, I only had four hours of lecture classes, so my schedule was free to work hard on one problem. My defense received a pass with distinction, unexpected but appreciated.
## What Next?
Memphis! There are so many interesting projects to work on at Memphis, but only time will tell. UMemphis has a really good supercomputer as well which is great for me. This summer I'm really looking at spending time enjoying my hobbies and art with no real obligations, a situation I'm likely to not fully appreciate until later.
