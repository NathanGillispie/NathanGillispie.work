# Abstract

[Our Group](https://dnascimento13.github.io/research_group/research.html) mostly focuses on quantum chemistry methods to simulate core-level spectroscopy. Relativistic effects are incredibly important for core
DFT is the method of choice, often used exchange correlation functional which turns out to be unimportant for simulating x-ray spectroscopies, results are being authored currently by Sarah Pak (soon to be Dr. Sarah Pak-Chung!).

## Funding

We are currently being funded by [NSF award 2337902](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2337902).
