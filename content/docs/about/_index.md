I'm Nathan, a chemistry graduate student based out of Memphis. I'm basically making music, writing code to do cool stuff, learning math while getting my PhD. After grad school, If I haven't signed my life away to UMG or Sony, I would like to work at a national lab, or as a software engineer.

I like riding motorcycles, cooking, making music, taking photos, and playing [go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)); however, these activities are always more enjoyable with my friends.
