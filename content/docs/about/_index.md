I'm Nathan, a chemistry graduate student based out of Memphis. I'm basically making
music, and writing code to do cool stuff while getting my PhD. After grad school,
I would like to work at a national lab, or as a software engineer.

I've made contributions to various quantum chemistry softwares in my first two years
of my PhD, including Psi4, PySCF, and TiDES. I've writen tens of thousands of lines
for bespoke, in-house quantum chemistry software (Mostly Python and C++).

I like riding motorcycles, cooking, making music, taking photos, and playing [go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game));
however, these activities are always more enjoyable with my friends.
