I'm Nathan, a graduate student based out of Memphis. I'm currently working on a few albums and photobooks while studying to be a chemist. After grad school, If I haven't signed my life away to UMG or Sony, I'll pursue a career at a national lab.

I like riding motorcycles, cooking, making music, taking photos, and playing [go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)); however, these activities are always more enjoyable with my friends.
