I'm Nathan, an undergrad based out of Bowling Green, just north of Nashville. I'm currently working on a few albums while studying to be a chemist. I plan on going to graduate school in 2024. After that, if I haven't signed my life away to UMG or Sony, I'll pursue a career in academia or at a national lab.

I like riding motorcycles, cooking and making music; however, these activities are always more enjoyable with my friends.
