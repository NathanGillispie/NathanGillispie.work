I'm a self-taught creative. I use photography as a tool to show the world in a novel and interesting way.

## I like to reflect the personalities of my subjects in my own visual style.

## Ideally, my shots are both representative and visually interesting.
This photo was taken for one of my album covers.

## Professional Work
Most of my professional work comes from senior portraits, some who did not want to expicitly photographed. Below is a long exposures of a subject playing their guitar.

The next senior portrait contains alterations to the original photograph by scanning resulting in a more visually interesting photo.

## Video
My most favorite tool is my 360 camera. I never have to worry about pointing the camera in the right direction. Composition with these cameras is a completely different experience.
