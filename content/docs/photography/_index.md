I'm a self-taught creative. Photography is relief and expression to me. This photo was taken for one of my album covers.

## Professional Work
Most of my professional work comes from senior portraits, some who did not want to expicitly photographed. The next two senior portraits contain alterations to the original photographs by scanning, resulting in more visually interesting photos.

## Video
My most favorite tool is my 360 camera. I never have to worry about pointing the camera in the right direction. Composition with these cameras is a completely different experience. A selection of some of the music videos I have made is available [here on my youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOQQl_Ne4nnkrJV2qpDnAtP3tiNKOZidO).
