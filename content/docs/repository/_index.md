Repositories have been made for the following:

## SOA-dynamics

This contains the most recent working version of my molecular dynamics code. Different branches are used for investigating different aspects of the system.

## Courses

I despise academic gatekeeping, so I've created repos for a few of the semesters I've spent at WKU. That infromation is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/NathanGillispie/).
