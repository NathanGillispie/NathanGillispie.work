## KiosPlugins

This is a repo for my VSTs. The only major one worth your time is PolySlew. They are based off the framework of the [AirWindows](https://www.airwindows.com/) plugins. Compiling yourself is not possible without the Steinberg VST2 SDK. A [release](https://github.com/NathanGillispie/KiosPlugins/releases/tag/VST) is available for both VSTs.

## water-nanoparticles-MD

This contains the Amber code used in my undergraduate thesis. Different branches are used for investigating different aspects of the system. Still in progress.
