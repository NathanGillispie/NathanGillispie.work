## core-spec-pyscf

This is a PySCF extension to make some things easier for core spectroscopy. You can
install it with `pip install core-spec-pyscf`!

## Psi4

My Psi4 fork is here. So far, I've added a relativistic Hamiltonian which can be used
with all references. The [PR](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/3292) has been accepted!

## TiDES

This is a child of the Kretchmer Group at Georgia Tech made for Real-Time electronic
structure calculations. I made a few contributions, mostly for adding relativistic
Hamiltonians. I've also used this a lot for my own curiosity. Very cool!

## PySCF

Forked so I could add the missing GHF stability method. [PR](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/pull/3058) was merged!

## KiosPlugins

This is a repo for my VSTs. The only one worth your time is PolySlew. Most are based
off the framework of the [AirWindows](https://www.airwindows.com/) plugins. A 
[release](https://github.com/NathanGillispie/KiosPlugins/releases/tag/VST) is available
for both VSTs.

## water-nanoparticles-MD

This contains the Amber code used in my undergraduate thesis. Different branches are
used for investigating different aspects of the system. Still in progress.
