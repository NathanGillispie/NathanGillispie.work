## KiosPlugins

This is a repo for my VSTs. The only major one worth your time is PolySlew. They are based off the framework of the [AirWindows](https://www.airwindows.com/) plugins. Compiling yourself is not possible without the Steinberg VST2 SDK. A [release](https://github.com/NathanGillispie/KiosPlugins/releases/tag/VST) is available for both VSTs.

## SOA-dynamics

This contains the most recent working version of my molecular dynamics code. Different branches are used for investigating different aspects of the system.

## Courses

I despise academic gatekeeping, so I've created repos for a few of the semesters I've spent at WKU.
