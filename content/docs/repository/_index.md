## core-spec-pyscf

This is a PySCF extension to make some things easier for core spectroscopy. You can install it with `pip install core-spec-pyscf`!

## Psi4

My Psi4 fork is here. This is one of the things I'm paid to do in grad school. So far I've added a relativistic Hamiltonian, PR is making its way through the pipeline.

## KiosPlugins

This is a repo for my VSTs. The only one worth your time is PolySlew. Most are based off the framework of the [AirWindows](https://www.airwindows.com/) plugins. A [release](https://github.com/NathanGillispie/KiosPlugins/releases/tag/VST) is available for both VSTs.

## water-nanoparticles-MD

This contains the Amber code used in my undergraduate thesis. Different branches are used for investigating different aspects of the system. Still in progress.
